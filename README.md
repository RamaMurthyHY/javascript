# javascript Questions

<details><summary><b>What is Javascript?</b></summary>

Javascript is high-level, interpreted programming language, It is primary used for interactive or dynamic web-applications(Frontend), in later days with support of frameworks such as NodeJs, javascript is also able to use in server-side programming(Backend)

- <b>Versatility:</b> Javascript is a multi-purpose programming language, we can use it for Web development, Mobile application development, Server-side(Backend) application, Game application development and more.

- <b>Scripting Language:</b> A script is a sequence of instructions that can be interpreted by a computer or other device to perform a specific task or set of tasks. A scripting language is a programming language that is used to write scripts that can be interpreted by a computer or other device to perform a specific task or set of tasks. Some examples of scripting languages include JavaScript, Python, and Ruby.

- <b>Interpreter Based:</b> Javascript is interpreted based, interpreter will take instruction at a time and executes it where as compiler compiles entire code as a machine code and then runs it

- <b>Event Handling:</b> Event handling is a process of capturing or responding to a particular event in web application, such a button click, keyboard key press, mouse drag etc, event handler (a callback function) will perform a specified action on a particular event occurred

- <b>Light Weight:</b> Javascript is often referred to as a light weight, becaus of its interpreter nature which enables it compile step not needed, syntax is simple and straight forward, javascript runs in browser also so no need of separate environment to run it

- <b>Objects as first-class Citizens:</b> An entity or element of programming language is called first-class citizen when it support operations such as assigning to a variable, modifying, passing as an argument or returning from a function.

- <b>Dynamic Typing:</b> Javascript is a dynamically tying, that means type of a variable is dynamically can be changed during run time depending on the value it holds

<details><summary><b>What is an Interpreter?</b></summary>

Interpreter is a program that takes the script or code and runs each line at a time without compiling whole program as a compiler,

| Interpreter                                                                                          | Compiler                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Interpreter interprets one line at a time and runs code                                              | Compiler compiles a entire program to machine language and runs that machine code    |
| Since it compile before run the output it is bit faster than the compiler                            | Since it compiles the entire program into machine language, it will run faster       |
| If any there is any error in the code, interpreter will stops interpreting there and give that error | It compiles entire code and gives all the compiler errors without stopping at middle |

<details><summary><b>What is a named function?</b></summary>

A function defined with name is known as named function

```
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}


// Calling the function
greet("John");
```

As in the above example code, the function is defined with a name <b>greet</b>, and this named functions are reusable throughout the code, it can be called as many times as need
